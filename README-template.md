# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution


### The challenge

The challenge is to build out a responsive order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The users should be able to see hover states for interactive elements.

### Links
I deployed this completed challenge on Netlify:
- https://order-component.netlify.app/

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Firefox developer tools


### What I learned
This was a simple challenge but I approached it "mobile first" which I have never done before and I realize that it's definitely a better choice. 
I changed browser and started using Mozilla Firefox for the Dev. tools and had an amazing experience with it compared to the Chrome dev. tools.
I used flexbox and grid to complete this challenge,used a few media queries and implemented hover states.

### What should I focus on in the future to improve my skills?

There are still some things I'm not comfortable with. 
I definitely need to practice and get more in depth with Flexbox and Grid and learn how to create responsive layouts with them.
